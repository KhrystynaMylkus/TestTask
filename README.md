# TestTask
Here is a solution using the strategy pattern for aggregation types, we can define aggregation strategies as classes,then create
 instances of these strategies based on the requested aggregation type and use them accordingly.
 It uses a generator to efficiently calculate the aggregated temperature for each city without
 loading all data into memory and heap to find the top N cities efficiently.
